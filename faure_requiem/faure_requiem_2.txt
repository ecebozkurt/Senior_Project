5 Faure's Requiem recommendations?             I'm looking to pick this up but I don't know which recording to get. At the moment I'm looking at Gardiner, Giulini, Herreweghe and Dutoit but I can't find many good reviews on them. I had a search on here but didn't find much either.         

2895        Funny, I was just wondering the same thing. If I don't get any strong recommendations I'm going to go for the Gardiner version. I'll report back if I do.         

7487Blog Entries1        I like the old Fournet stereo & don't quite agree with the luke-warm review on MusicWeb. It is a Philips budget release & has a very generous content with Pelleas et Melisande and the Pavane too http://www.amazon.com/Faur%C3%A9-Req.../dp/B000058AYSAdmittedly though it's been a while since I heard the disc & I haven't done any strict comparison.I also have Dutoit & will give it a listen.Herreweghe is on you-t, I believe.

4858        This is the recording I have, and have been very happy with it:61031N3GBQL._SX300_.jpgJohn Rutter conducting the Cambridge Singers and members of the London Sinfonia.  As I understand it, this is Faure's actual version - the more common one with full orchestration was not approved by him.  This recording is as he wrote it.  Smaller scale, very warm and intimate, I love this recording.         ahammel, Sid James liked this post

Smaller scale, very warm and intimate, I love this recording.I cannot recall which recording from decades ago impressed me very well, but it was the opposite of 'grand' even in the 'larger moments.' It seemed to more readily match what we know of Faure's personality, quiet, near freakishly unpretentious and unassuming. So whichever has no 'grand gestures' or much more than Forte moments, is what I would be looking for. This one sounds very much like what I would be looking for. Overall rather quiet, restrained, through which the work, imo, gains the greatest power.         Kazaman, Sid James liked this post

I don't listen to it all the time, but every time I do, I ask myself why I don't listen to it more frequently.  I do also like the big, full orchestra choral works as well, but this one just works so well with the smaller forces.  Very similar to how I prefer Barber's Adagio for Strings in its original string quartet format.         Sid James liked this post

Smaller scale, very warm and intimate, I love this recording.I've just purchased this recording, and can second the recommendation. The scoring is very well done, and the intimate sound is entirely appropriate for 'un petit Requiem". As an aside: the editorial notes of the Phillip Legge version of the score (IMSLP) make entertaining reading regarding the deficiencies of the 1900 edition: "The number of misprints and obvious mistakes is astounding; there seems to be hardly a page where one cannot find multiple errors in the musical text, let alone infelicities of slipshod engraving!"         

58612        Dutoit (rec. 1987, John Dunkerley, engineer). Good couplings, too.   

5772        I enjoy the Rutter recording, but my personal favorite is the one by Richard Hickox: Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Pristine sound quality--very quiet, evocative of a "berceuse", and careful performance.         PetrB, TrevBus liked this post       

447        I sang this requiem once and thoroughly enjoyed it. The only recording I've heard is my CD of the Gardiner, which is very good, I think.         

16571        This is another good one of the original, chamber sized version. Dunno if its easy to get now though?:  

51        My favorite is with King's College Choir and Sir David Willcocks, but I'll admit that they could sing the phone book and I would probably buy it.         

34        I second Peterinch's recommendation of the Wilcocks recording. Beautiful, deeply spiritual performance.http://www.amazon.com/Faur%C3%A9-Req...quiem+wilcocks  

5        Thanks for all the suggestions everyone, I'm not sure this made it any easier but there's certainly plenty to think about!I managed to hear Rutter's recording the other day and I was very impressed with it. Still haven't decided which to go for yet but this one is definitely looking to be a favourite.         

6783        Hello Aghartha,I thought I would put in my two cents.  I own 7 versions of Faure's lovely requiem mass, opus 48, and have heard many others.  If you want the full orchestral arrangement I recommend going with Hickox.  There is nothing wrong with the orchestral arrangement, it would not be my first choice, but it is many people's favorite.  I think there is a bit of a sentiment that since Faure was commissioned to turn his chamber arrangement into an orchestral one, for pay, it is somehow lesser - artistic integrity in the face of monetary gain and all that jazz.  But if you like it - like it, without shame.If you want Faure's chamber arrangement go with Rutter.  I believe Rutter actually arranged this version; there is some speculation as to whether an entirely accurate original arrangement even exists, but Rutter, if I remember correctly, got as close as he could.  The perk with this version is with the rest of the program, you get the lovely Cantique de Jean Racine, Op. 11 and Messe basse.  You want these pieces.My third recommendation is the Wager reduced "organ" arrangement.  Another lovely chamber version here. I think the strength in this recording is the soloists, which I think are stronger than The Cambridge Singers represented on the Ruttter recording.  The other perk with this options is that it is couple with the Durufle requiem, opus 9.  You want this piece, which is as frustrating as the Faure because there are also various arrangements.  I think for the Durufle this is superlative.In short, get all three.  I think they are the best versions of their respective arrangements.  I would not want to live without any of them.  The other 4 I have, on the other hand, I can go without.regards,M1.jpg2.jpgFaure Hickox.jpg             Last edited by Selby;
