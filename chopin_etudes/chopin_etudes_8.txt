2781 looking for Chopin recordings             I own Maurizio Pollini's recordings of the Polonaises and the Etudes on DG, but I really want very good recordings of other Chopin pieces, specifically the Nocturnes, Preludes, and Mazurkas. I want recordings that are beautifully recorded, and beautifully performed. I by far prefer a higher-fidelity performance, no offense to great old performances, I just don't want to feel like I'm hearing Chopin through a tin can. Any help would be vastly appreciated ^_^         

97        Well, you can be quite safe to go Rubinstein route which is available at quite attractive price. Even it is old, the sound is very good from RCA's golden age.For "higher-fidelity", I quite like Garrick Ohlsson's complete Chopin works, also available at decent price.http://www.amazon.com/Rubinstein-Pla...instein+chopinhttp://www.amazon.com/Chopin-Complet...ohlsson+chopinNote: The second set can be purchased at less than $65 at Berkshire.         mensch liked this post

It ought to be forbidden to ignorant innocents, never allowed into contact with those not sufficiently prepared. Yes, art is dangerous. Where it is chaste, it is not art.

3906Blog Entries1        Seconding Rubinstein. I'm listening to the complete Rubinstein box and it's revelation after revelation. The video from Russia around 1961 is superhuman. I've ever seen anything like it.                    Last edited by bigshot; 

541        I would rarely go for a complete edition, but DG's 2010 anniversary boxset was so raved about for its uniform strength of interpretations and reasonable price, that I do feel it is worth a mention here:http://www.amazon.co.uk/Chopin-Compl...2555148&sr=1-2"My Mother was always far too busy putting the boiled chicken through the deflavouriser to have ever considered committing suicide".

20201        Concerti: Dang Thai Son and the Orchestra of the 18th Century conducted by Franz Bruggen.         

97        I was so drew into Dang Thai Son that I purchased his complete Nocturnes and Precludes. Unfortunately, the wooden mechanical approach completely bored me to death!

Unfortunately, the wooden mechanical approach completely bored me to death! The concerti are brilliant though. Even if they are crap pieces of music, they are played beautifully.         

4407        Excellent suggestions so far,...especially from St.Luke...I also recommend you get yourself the Earl Wild complete etudes as well; if you're ready to hear them better than ever, that is.         

2781        I love Rubenstein's playing, but I really would love something with higher fidelity. Any more recent recordings that are played as well, but the recording equipment doesn't hinder the sound? I can't find anywhere to listen to the Earl Wild Nocturnes (its not cheap enough for me to risk buying it without hearing it first), can anybody point me to where I can sample it before I pay for it?         

3906Blog Entries1        Rubinstein was recorded on the Living Stereo label. Sound quality doesn't get much better than that.On a related note, I got this DVD a couple of weeks ago and it totally blew me away. This is the most amazing classical concert video I've ever seen. Superhuman.http://www.amazon.com/Classic-Archiv...dp/B001IMFHVG/  

294        You'll never loose with Rubinstein. I personally like Vladimir  Ashkenazy's Chopin recordings as well.       Another day, another Dinar
