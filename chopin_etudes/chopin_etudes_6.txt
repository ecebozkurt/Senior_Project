494 Favourite Chopin interpreter?             I have 2 seperate disks of chopin but they are no name partworks series disks, not the best quality,  and I'd like a 2 disk set of preludes, etudes etc, but who is the 'best' interpreter of Chopin?  What set should I be looking for?       I'm playing the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order!

What set should I be looking for?Chopin's really hard to pull off because on the one hand there's a sort of psychological side to the music - hallucinogenic trippy music. But at the same time there's a political element - Polish national pride, strength.The best Chopinists I've heard are Vladimir Sofronitsky and Alfred Cortot and Benno Moiseiewitsch and Mikhail Pletnev and Ivo Pogorelich and Arturo Beneditti Michelangeli and Georges Czifffa and Maurizio Pollini. My suggestion is you start to explore them via youtube and see how you like it.                    Last edited by Mandryka; 

494        Thanks. I remember vaguely a 2 disk set from DG a few years ago with a blue cover but cant remember the pianist.       I'm playing the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order!

14520        I find it hard to only have one "favourite" in any music, let alone Chopin!Arthur Rubinstein is an essential Chopinist, as are Egon Petri, Benno Moiseiwitsch, Alfred Cortot, Leopold Godowsky, Jorge Bolet, Sviatoslav Richter, Samson Francois, Earl Wild. Shura Cherkassky live in Slazburg 1968 is sublime in the preludes if You can stand the "vintage" sound quality. (All dead dudes, with an old-school free attitude to interpretation that I prefer to modern technically superior pianists that don't know squat about the music..  )I think that the 

494        I would just like a set with as many of them as possible all together, one pianist, no idea which pianist is best. I find it hard to determine one from another.  I'm not as knowledgeable as you lot.       I'm playing the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order!

26597I have this set in its original Philips incarnation and like it a lot. stereoalso like Arrau's set and Ohlsson's set.       When all else fails, listen to Thick as a Brick.   Lukecash12 liked this post       

42254        A lot of my Chopin listening is Rubinstein and Horowitz. Guess I'm just a Neanderthal. No, don't deny it! Many people have told me that... ;-)Somebody wanting a good meaty box set could do worse then Rubinstein. This looks like the latest incarnation of his set, ten CDs and cheap!http://www.amazon.com/Arthur-Rubinst...pin+rubinsteinFor a good stereo version of the Op. 28 Preludes, though, look elsewhere.

494        Must be good sound.  Im curious about Cortot having read a piece on him in International Piano Magazine.  But I want modern stereo recordings.       I'm playing the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order!  Vaneyes liked this post       

3725Blog Entries2        Ken's suggestion of Rubinstein's stereo recordings will do the job if you want a cheap and convenient box of all the important pieces played and recorded well by a top pianist. Played better than well in the case of the polonaises and the nocturne op 48/1.Problem solved, well done Ken.                    Last edited by Mandryka; 

60931        Artur Rubinstein's Chopin will never disappoint.       Facts don't care about your feelings.  Ingelou, Bruce, Vaneyes and 7 others liked this post       

5652        I have to agree with many others here that Rubinstein is the best representative of Chopin's music. However, I'll also admit that I'm subject to the law of first hearing--for quite a while, Rubinstein was the only pianist I heard play Chopin. One gets very quickly used to a particular performance. But Rubinstein's recordings now have the advantage of being well recorded, and of being available inexpensively. That said, however, I've also come to love Robert Browning's version of Chopin's Etudes, and Pollini's recording of his Preludes. I would also highly recommend Moravec for any Chopin you can find. He has a remarkably smooth touch--listening to him play Chopin is like listening to aural silk. I have a few recordings of Chopin works by Luisada, and while I have read some less than satisfactory reviews of his playing, I found it to be some of the best--at least in the few pieces I've heard him record (also on no name partworks series). But I think if you stick to some of the well-known pianists, you can't go far wrong. And it will be worth your while to explore several different pianists, which I think helps you appreciate the composer more. Different performers will bring out different aspects of his work.         hpowders, WJM liked this post       

60931        All true, but for the new listener who doesn't want the hassle of sifting through so many individual performers, any Chopin by Rubinstein is the easy way to do it and one can be assured the performances will rank with the best available.Then, after discovering one's favorite Chopin works, one can branch out and get performances by other pianists. That's when the fun begins, with comparative listening, my favorite hobby!                    Last edited by hpowders; 

37282        Since these deals tend to disappear, I thought I'd mention this box of solo-piano Chopin recordings selling on Amazon for $0.99 I just came across.  I know the the Moravec recordings on it very well and recommend them, but haven't heard the others.  http://www.amazon.com/Moravec-Johann...rds=chopin+boxI'm curious about the Abbey Simon, who I've enjoyed in Ravel--so I guess I'll download it myself!*p.s.* A review of some of the Abbey Simon performances: http://www.classicstoday.com/review/review-6193/             Last edited by Blancrocher;
