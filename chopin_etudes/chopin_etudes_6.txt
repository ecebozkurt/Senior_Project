3554 Chopin Etudes Op 10/25             This is some of my favorite music, and for me, Mauricio Pollini's DG recording, now over 40 years old, is the desert island disc.  I also have  complete recordings by Earl Wild  and Garrick Ohlsson, two Pianists that I greatly admire, but Pollini seems to present each etude as a Fabrege Egg, brilliant, beautiful and breathtaking all at once.    Any other favorites?         

9518        There are the French Chopinists, e.g. Samson Francois and Casadesus...       I spent a fortune on deodorant before I realized that people don't like me anyway.  PetrB liked this post       

192        Ashkenazy's is good but I like Pollini's cycle more. Horowitz, for the etudes he did record, is my favorite though.       When eminent biologist and author Lewis Thomas was asked what message he would choose to send from Earth into outer space in the Voyager spacecraft, he answered, "I would send the complete works of Johann Sebastian Bach." After a pause, he added, "But that would be boasting."

Any other favorites?There are quite a few recordings of them by Pollini, if you liked the DG one then I strongly suspect you'd like the earlier recording on Testament even more - I do.

122        I haven't listened to Chopin enough (yet) which is both a good and bad thing  however I recently picked up the Etude 's op 10 and 25 by Tatiana Shebanova who plays on an Erard from 1849, same type as Chopin used, certainly worth listening to just to hear how it sounds but I think they are very well done. The other set I'm listening to is op 25 by Grigori (gregory) Ginzburg, his Chopin and Liszt are exceptional and worth the trouble of finding though they are mono recordings which some may not like.

What do you think of the way Ginzberg plays Winter Winds? It's one of the strangest Chopin performances I've ever heard.

Horowitz, for the etudes he did record, is my favorite though.There are two recordings by Ashkenazy. By far the best is the earlier one, a Melodiya recording. There's a very entertaining selection of Horowitz's Chopin in one of his volumes of Great Pianists of the 20th century. The more I hear Horowitz the less I like it.

So I don't think its one I listen to but the rest are great

30108        A lot of people like this one for its poetry. I prefer a bit more drama. In fact, I just put my SACD vesion for sale on Amazon!  brotagonist liked this post
